# ArrowTests

ArrowFileTest.kt: Shows how to create an Arrow schema with one field, write it into a file and read the data from the same file
ArrowTypesTest.kt: Using a Schema and a VectorSchemaRoot, we store different types of data (Timestamp, Numeric, Symbolic)
ArrowVectorsTests.kt: In this example we directly manipulate FieldVector and implement Timestamp, Numeric, Symbolic, and Uncertain.
